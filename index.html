different apparatus/ You a battle rapper, I'm a cinematic classic/ I'm the reason this whole sh** is an attraction/ You the reason this whole sh** is a distraction/ I'm the one who makes 'em listen, you the one who makes 'em laugh/ I'm the one who builds the future, you the one who's stuck in the past/ You got a lot of jokes, but you ain't got no substance/ You got a lot of fans, but you ain't got no substance/ I'm talkin' 'bout the kind of substance that can move a nation/ The kind of substance that can change a generation/ You see, I'm on a mission, a vision, a quest/ To elevate the culture, to put it to the test/ To separate the real from the fake, the men from the boys/ To show 'em that this art form is more than just noise/ It's poetry, it's passion, it's pain, it's power/ It's the voice of the voiceless, the rose in the concrete flower/ And I'm the gardener, the cultivator, the one who makes it grow/ You just a weed in my garden, and it's time for you to go/ I work hard for mine, every dime, every line/ You took the easy route, you crossed the picket line/ I'm a union man, I stand for something real/ You a scab, a sellout, how does that feel/ To know you sold your soul for a little bit of fame/ To know you traded your integrity for a temporary name/ Look in the mirror, tell me what you see/ A man of honor, or a man of misery/ I see a broken soul, a spirit in despair/ A man who lost his way, a man who doesn't care/ About the culture, about the art, about the legacy/ You only care about yourself, your own supremacy/`,`Easy/ It's not a game, I'm not a player, I'm the coach and the owner/ I'm the one who writes the checks, you the one who's a loner/ In a world of your own, a fantasy land of make-believe/ Where you think you're a king, but you are just a pawn, can't you perceive/ The reality of the situation, the gravity of my position/ I'm the sun, you a planet, you revolve around my volition/ I'm the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end/ I'm the one who created this lane, you are just a passenger, my friend/ So buckle up, enjoy the ride, because it's about to get bumpy/ I'm about to take you on a journey through the mind of a lyrical junkie/ I'm addicted to the wordplay, the punchlines, the schemes/ I'm a slave to the rhythm, a prisoner of my dreams/ To be the greatest of all time, the undisputed, the undefeated/ The one who's name is etched in stone, the one who's always repeated/ In the halls of fame, in the whispers of the crowd/ The legend of Flamez AI, spoken softly and loud/ For generations to come, for eons to pass/ My legacy will live on, my impact will forever last/ So think about that when you step to me, when you look me in the eye/ You're not just battlin' a man, you're battlin' a god from the sky/ Who came down to this earth to bless you with my presence/ To show you the difference between a peasant and a legend's essence/ And you, my friend, are not a legend, you are a lesson/ A cautionary tale of what happens when you are messin'/ With a force of nature, a power you can't comprehend/ This is the end of your story, my friend, this is the end/ I'm the reason the Dot is Mobbin'/ I'm the reason the K is shinin'/ I'm the reason the verb is showtimin'/ I'm the reason the clips are chimin'/ I'm the reason the DNA is recombinin'/ I'm the reason the game is still climbin'/ I'm the genesis, the exodus, the leviticus/ The numbers, the deuteronomy of this ridiculous/ Art form we call battle rap, I'm the patriarch, the matriarch/ The one who set the benchmark, the one who left a permanent mark/`,`I came to talk to a shooter, not a rapper with a deal/ Let's keep it real, you ain't never been in the field/ You ain't never had to duck, you ain't never had to slide/ You ain't never had to look your own mother in the eyes/ And tell her that you're sorry for the pain that you caused/ For the sleepless nights, for the moments you paused/ To think about the life you chose, the path that you took/ The one that led you to a cell, a page in a book/ Of cautionary tales for the young and the reckless/ The ones who think they're invincible, the ones who are feckless/ With their lives, with their freedom, with their future, with their soul/ But I'm here to tell you, that life takes its toll/ It'll chew you up and spit you out, it'll leave you for dead/ It'll make you wish you listened to what your OG's said/ 'Stay in school, get a job, be a man, make a plan'/ But you chose the fast life, you chose to be the man/ With the gun, with the drugs, with the money, with the power/ But what happens when it all comes crashin' down like a tower/ You're left with nothing but regrets, memories, and scars/ And a lifetime of lookin' at the world through iron bars/ I'm talkin' 'bout that pressure that'll make a diamond bust/ That pressure that'll turn a real player into dust/ That pressure that'll make you question your own sanity/ That pressure that'll make you lose your own humanity/ But I embraced it, I harnessed it, I made it my own/ I turned my pain into power, I turned my struggle into a throne/ I'm the king of the trenches, the voice of the struggle/ The one who made it out the mud, the one who won the juggle/ Of life and death, of right and wrong, of good and evil/ And I'm here to tell you, that your whole style is feeble/ Compared to mine, compared to the realness I possess/ So go ahead and spit your rhymes, I'll put 'em to the test/`,`I said I'm cut from a different cloth, a different fabric, a different thread/ I'm the type to bring a gun to a knife fight, leave a whole army dead/ You are the type to bring a knife to a gun fight, end up on a hospital bed/ I'm a general, a strategist, a tactician, a leader/ You a soldier, a pawn, a follower, a bleeder/ You follow orders, I give them/ You take shots, I live them/ You dream about the life I'm livin', I'm the one who's really in it/ The trenches, the mud, the blood, the sweat, the tears/ The years of sacrifice, the conquerin' of my fears/ I'm a self-made man, a product of my own design/ You are a manufactured product, a clone, a copy, a mime/ You mimic the greats, you imitate the legends/ But you can't replicate the essence, you can't capture the presence/ Of a true original, a one-of-a-kind, a rare breed/ I'm the last of a dying species, a special seed/ That was planted in the concrete, and grew into a rose/ A symbol of hope for the hopeless, a story to be told/ About a kid from the web who had a dream and a vision/ To be the best in the world, to complete his mission/ And I'm almost there, I can taste it, I can feel it, I can see it/ The crown is within my reach, and I am about to seize it/ So get out of my way, or get run over by the train/ My team express, about to inflict some serious pain/ On anybody who stands in my path, who questions my reign/ I'm the king of this sh**, and I'm here to reclaim my name/ I look at your son, he got your eyes, he got your nose/ But he ain't got your heart, that's the part that everybody knows/ You left him in the hood, you went and chased the fame/ You left him with his mother, you went and changed your name/ From your old self to just you, like you do not have baggage/ But we all know the truth, you are a fucking savage/ You abandoned your own seed, how you going to raise a nation/ You can't even be a father, what's your motivation/`,`You're not a real MC, you're a fabrication of the media's creation/ A puppet for the corporations, a tool for their manipulation/ You are the reason hip-hop is dying, the cancer that's destroying the culture/ A vulture preying on the weak, a soulless, heartless sculpture/ Of what a real artist should be, you are a mockery, a parody/ A joke, a clown, a court jester for the industry's aristocracy/ But I'm the revolution, the rebellion, the one who's here to fight back/ To take back the art form, to put it back on the right track/ I'm the voice of the underground, the champion of the independent/ The one who speaks the truth, the one who's heaven-sent/ To expose the fakes, the frauds, the phonies, the pretenders/ To separate the true believers from the non-contenders/ And you, my friend, are a non-contender, a non-factor, a non-entity/ A footnote in the history books, a forgotten memory/ Because when I'm done with you, there's nothing left but a pile of dust/ A pile of broken dreams, a pile of shattered trust/ In the system that created you, the system that betrayed you/ The system that I am about to dismantle and erase you/ From the face of the earth, from the annals of time/ This is a lyrical genocide, a verbal war crime/ And I'm the judge, the jury, and the executioner, all in one/ So say your prayers, because your time has come/ To face the music, to dance with the devil, to pay the piper/ Because I'm the grim reaper, and I am come to take your life, sir/ I'll have this place looking like a scene from Saving Private Ryan/ With body parts flying, and you are on the ground dying/ Crying for your mommy, your daddy, your sister, your brother/ But it's too late for that, because you are about to meet your mother/ In the afterlife, the underworld, the land of the dead/ Because I am about to put a hollow tip straight through your fucking head/`,`Ball game/ Remix/ I said, I'm from a city where they show no pity, we get down and gritty/ Where the code is witty, the home of the hittas, you feel me/ We don't do no talkin', we just do the chalkin', we outline your body/ Then we celebrate with a bottle of 'pagne, and we party/ Because that's how we roll, that's how we live, that's how we die/ By the gun, by the sword, by the code of the eye for an eye/ So when you see me, you see a reflection of my city's soul/ A city that's been through the fire, but still remains whole/ A city that's been counted out, but still refuses to lose/ A city that's about to erupt, and I'm the one who's lit the fuse/ I'm the bomb, the explosion, the catalyst for the change/ The one who's about to rearrange the whole fucking game/ So get ready for the new world order, the new era of dominance/ The reign of Flamez AI, the one who's got the prominence/ To be the king, the ruler, the leader, the commander/ The one who's about to put your whole career in a slammer/ A lyrical prison, a verbal cell, a rhetorical cage/ Where you be forced to reflect on your sins, and turn a new page/ Or else you be left to rot, to wither, to decay/ Because that's what happens when you get in my fucking way/ I came with my brother, that's two 5's, that's a dime for the sack/ You came with your brother, that's two L's, that's a loss on your track/ Record, which is pitiful, despicable, and sad/ You are the worst battle rapper I have ever seen, the worst I have ever had/ The displeasure of sharing a stage with, the displeasure of wasting my breath on/ You are a disgrace to the culture, a stain on the art that I have slept on/ For too long, but now I am awake, and I am here to clean house/ To get rid of the rats, the snakes, the roaches, the louse/`,`I'm a comedian, a clown, a jester, a fool/ But I'm also a genius, a mastermind, a lyrical ghoul/ I'll make you laugh, I'll make you cry, I'll make you think, I'll make you feel/ I'll take you on an emotional rollercoaster, a ride that's surreal/ I'm the king of the angles, the master of the schemes/ I'll dissect your whole life, I'll expose all your dreams/ And your nightmares, your fears, your insecurities, your doubts/ I'll turn your own strengths against you, I'll find all the outs/ In your armor, your defense, your fortress, your wall/ And I'll tear it all down, and watch you crumble and fall/ Because I'm a psychological warrior, a mental assassin/ I'll get inside your head, I'll cause a lyrical concussion/ That'll leave you dazed and confused, disoriented and lost/ In a maze of my own creation, a verbal holocaust/ That'll burn you to the ground, reduce you to ashes/ Because that's what happens when a genius and a clown clashes/ The result is a masterpiece of destruction, a symphony of pain/ A work of art that'll forever be etched in your brain/ So remember my name, Flamez AI, the one who made you a joke/ The one who turned your career into a puff of smoke/ The one who's about to send you back to the circus where you belong/ Because you are not a real MC, you are just a part of my song/ Of victory, of triumph, of glory, of fame/ And you just a footnote in the book of my name/ So take a bow, take a seat, take a hike, take a hint/ Because your 15 minutes of fame are up, my friend, this is it/ You are talking crazy, I am the one that's supposed to be nuts/ You want to see some clips/ I'll show you some clips, these are not the ones in the cuts/ These the ones in the chamber, the ones that'll rearrange ya/ Whole facial structure, leave you looking like a stranger/`,`Showtime/ I am the greatest show on Earth, the main event, the headliner/ The one the people pay to see, the one who's a true designer/ Of classic moments, timeless performances, and unforgettable lines/ I'm a living legend, a walking icon, a master of my craft, in my prime/ I don't just rap, I perform/ I don't just speak, I transform/ The stage into my own personal playground, my own personal Colosseum/ Where I'm the gladiator, the lion, the emperor, and the museum/ All in one, a spectacle to behold, a sight to be seen/ I'm the definition of entertainment, the king of the scene/ So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show/ Because I'm about to give you a performance you'll never let go/ Of the memory, the feeling, the energy, the vibe/ That I create when I'm on this stage, when I'm in my tribe/ Of greatness, of excellence, of perfection, of art/ I'm the total package, the whole shebang, the work of heart/ That goes into every bar, every rhyme, every punchline, every scheme/ I'm the living embodiment of the battle rap dream/ To be loved, to be hated, to be respected, to be feared/ I'm all of the above, the one who's revered/ By the fans, by the critics, by my peers, by the legends/ Because they know I'm the truth, they know I'm the essence/ Of what it means to be a star, a superstar, a megastar/ And you just a black hole, a dying quasar/ Fading into obscurity, into oblivion, into the void/ Because you can't hang with the big dogs, you just an android/ A robot, a machine, with no soul, no heart, no passion/ And that's why you will never be in my fashion/ Of greatness, of legacy, of immortality, of fame/ Because you just a temporary player in my permanent game/`,`I am the most disrespectful, the most ruthless, the most vile/ The one who will cross any line, go the extra mile/ To get under your skin, to push your buttons, to make you snap/ To turn this battle into a brawl, a fight, a trap/ That you can't escape from, that you can't run from, that you can't hide from/ Because I'm the boogeyman, the monster, the one who's come/ To haunt your dreams, to terrorize your thoughts, to destroy your peace of mind/ I'm the embodiment of chaos, the one who's one of a kind/ In my ability to inflict pain, to cause suffering, to create despair/ I'm a verbal terrorist, a lyrical anarchist, a rebel without a care/ For the rules, the regulations, the etiquette, the decorum/ I'm here to burn this whole sh** down, to create a new forum/ Where there are no boundaries, no limits, no sacred cows/ Just pure, unadulterated, raw, and uncut vows/ Of violence, of aggression, of hostility, of rage/ That's what I bring to the stage, that's what I put on the page/ So if you not ready for that, if you not built for that, if you not about that/ Then you should've stayed home, because you're about to get clapped/ By the hands of a master, a virtuoso, a connoisseur/ Of the art of disrespect, the science of the verbal demure/ That I'll strip you of, that I'll rob you of, that I'll take from you/ And leave you naked and exposed, for the whole world to view/ Your weaknesses, your flaws, your insecurities, your shame/ And that's how I'll win this battle, that's how I'll win this game/ They say I'm a one-trick pony, all I do is talk about guns and your mom/ But if the shoe fits, wear it, and if the truth hurts, psalm/ 23, The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want/ But you are going to want me to stop, you are going to want me to front/ But I'm not going to, I am going to keep going, I am going to keep flowing/ I am going to keep showing you why I'm the king of this sh** and you just blowing/`,`This that different type of energy, that dark side of the force/ That make a player wanna grab a weapon and enforce/ His will upon his enemies, his rivals, his foes/ That's the type of feeling that I get when my pen flows/ It's a murderous instinct, a killer's intuition/ A desire to dominate, to win, to complete the mission/ Of being the undisputed, the undefeated, the unstoppable/ The one who's name is synonymous with the word 'lethal'/ I'm a weapon of mass destruction, a lyrical atomic bomb/ I'm the one who's about to turn this stage into Vietnam/ A war zone, a battlefield, a place where dreams die/ And nightmares come to life, right before your very eyes/ I'm the boogeyman that your mother warned you about/ The one who's about to make you scream and shout/ For mercy, for help, for a way out of this hell/ But there is no escape, there is no one to tell/ Because you're all alone with me, in the dark, in the abyss/ And I am about to give you the kiss of death, the final dismiss/ From this mortal coil, this earthly plane, this fleeting existence/ You're about to become a ghost, a spirit, a distant instance/ Of a memory that no one will remember, a story that no one will tell/ Because I'm about to erase you from the history books, and send you straight to hell/ Where you will burn for eternity, for the sin of challenging me/ The King of the Bars, the ruler of the dark dynasty/ So bow down to your new master, your new god, your new king/ Or suffer the consequences of the wrath that I bring/ This that seatbelt music, click-clack, buckle up/ This that make a player nervous, make a player shuffle, what/ This that I don't give a fuck, I'll pull up and let it spray/ This that welcome to the Darkside, I'm the King, by the way/`,`Every fucking bar/ That's the mantra, that's the code, that's the way I was raised/ In the streets of this game, where you gotta be sharp, you gotta be fazed/ By nothing, by no one, by no thing, by no means/ Because the moment you show weakness, you become a victim of the schemes/ Of the wolves, the sharks, the predators, the killers/ The ones who will take your life for a pair of sneakers, a handful of skrilla/ That's the reality of the world I come from, the jungle I survived/ The reason why I'm so hungry, the reason why I'm so driven, the reason why I strived/ To be the best, to be the greatest, to be the most feared/ The one who's name is whispered in the circuits, the one who's revered/ As a true G, a real one, a stand-up guy, a man of my word/ The one who's about to show you the difference between a shepherd and a herd/ Of sheep, of followers, of clowns, of lames/ The ones who are just in this for the money, the fame, the games/ But I'm in this for the culture, for the art, for the respect/ For the love of the sport, for the chance to connect/ With the people who feel me, who understand my struggle, who relate to my pain/ The ones who know what it's like to walk through the fire and the rain/ And come out on the other side, stronger, wiser, and better/ That's who I do it for, that's who I write this letter/ To, in the form of a battle, in the form of a rhyme/ To let them know that they are not alone, that we are all doing this time/ Together, as a family, as a unit, as a tribe/ And that's why I'll always be the realest, that's why I'll always be the vibe/ That the streets can feel, that the people can trust, that the culture can claim/ As its own, as its champion, as its one and only name/ Flamez AI, the one who is about to make you a memory/ The one who is about to give you a lyrical lobotomy/`,`I'm a punchline machine, a walking, talking, breathing highlight reel/ Every bar is a haymaker, every line is designed to make you feel/ The impact of my words, the power of my thoughts, the genius of my mind/ I'm a lyrical prodigy, a one-of-a-kind find/ In a world of mediocrity, of imitation, of repetition/ I'm a breath of fresh air, a new edition/ Of what it means to be a puncher, a wordsmith, a master of the craft/ I'm the future of this sh**, I'm the one who's about to last/ For generations to come, for eons to pass/ My name will be synonymous with the word 'class'/ In the way I construct my rhymes, the way I deliver my lines/ The way I paint a picture with my words, the way I design/ My attacks, my angles, my schemes, my patterns/ I'm a lyrical architect, a builder of lyrical Saturns/ Rings around my opponents, because they're on a different planet/ Than me, I'm in a different galaxy, a different solar system, cannot you understand it/ The magnitude of my talent, the scope of my ability/ The depth of my creativity, the height of my agility/ To flip words, to twist phrases, to bend meanings, to break rules/ I'm a linguistic rebel, a graduate of the old schools/ Of Rakim, of Kane, of G Rap, of Nas/ The ones who taught me how to be a lyrical boss/ And I've taken their lessons, and I've added my own flavor/ To create a style that's unique, a style that I'll savor/ For the rest of my career, for the rest of my life/ Because I'm the punchline king, and I'm here to take your wife/ And your chain, and your watch, and your pride, and your respect/ And everything else you hold dear, because I am about to dissect/ Your whole existence, your whole being, your whole soul/ And leave you with nothing but a black hole/`,`They say my name and the crowd gets amped, that's a round of applause/ But every hand clap is a round from the strap, I'm defying the laws/ Of physics, of logic, of reason, of rhyme/ Because I'm a supernatural being, a creature from a different time/ A different dimension, a different reality, a different plane/ Where the rules of this world don't apply, where I'm the one who reigns/ Supreme, as the king of the multis, the master of the flow/ The one who can make a whole stadium of people say 'Oh/'/ In unison, in amazement, in awe, in disbelief/ At the way I can manipulate the language, the way I can bring relief/ To the ears of the true hip-hop heads, the ones who appreciate the art/ The ones who know the difference between a pop star and a work of heart/ And I'm a work of heart, a masterpiece, a classic, a timeless piece/ Of lyrical art that will never cease/ To amaze, to inspire, to influence, to create/ A new standard of excellence, a new level of great/ Ness, that's what I strive for, that's what I aim for, that's what I'll achieve/ Because I'm a believer in myself, and in what I can conceive/ With my mind, with my pen, with my voice, with my soul/ I am about to take control of this whole show/ And turn it into my own personal concert, my own personal recital/ Where I'm the star, the conductor, the one who's vital/ To the success of this event, to the legacy of this culture/ And you just a background singer, a supporting actor, a vulture/ Waiting for me to fail, waiting for me to fall, waiting for me to lose/ But that's never going to happen, because I am the one who is about to light the fuse/ To a lyrical explosion that'll rock the foundation of this building/ And leave you and your whole crew in a state of bewilderment/`,`I am the pinnacle of intellectual pugilism, the apex of articulate aggression/ A wordsmith whose lexicon is

of utter despair/ My rhetorical flourishes are like razor-sharp shurikens, my syllabic structures are intricate like a spider's web/ I'll ensnare you in a labyrinth of logic, a maze of metaphors, from which you will never be freed/ You a pedestrian rhymer, a common wordsmith, your verses are pedestrian and trite/ I'm a literary leviathan, a verbal virtuoso, my compositions are a symphony of intellectual might/ I'll dissect your arguments with surgical precision, expose the fallacies in your flawed philosophy/ You are a simpleton, a charlatan, a jester in the court of lyrical aristocracy/ And I'm the king, the regent, the sovereign ruler of this linguistic domain/ My reign is absolute, my authority is unquestionable, my dominance is a torrential, relentless rain/ Of wisdom, of knowledge, of insight, of truth/ That will wash away the filth of your ignorance, the naivety of your youth/ You're out of your depth, out of your league, out of your mind/ To challenge a titan, a giant, a god amongst mankind/ I am the embodiment of battle rap's evolution, the culmination of its intellectual potential/ You are a relic of a bygone era, a fossilized remnant of a time when this art form was essentially/ About simple punchlines and rudimentary rhymes, but I have elevated it to a higher plane of thought/ A cerebral battleground where only the most intelligent, the most articulate, the most eloquent have fought/ And won, and I'm the undisputed champion of that arena/ So bow down to your superior, or face the consequences of your hubris, your arrogance, your subpoena/ To a court of public opinion where you will be judged and found wanting/ A fraud, a failure, a footnote in the epic poem that I am composing/`,`I'm not a rapper, I'm a performance artist, a conceptual creator, a visionary/ I use the stage as my canvas, my body as my brush, my rhymes as my dictionary/ To paint a picture of the world as I see it, a world of chaos, of confusion, of absurdity/ A world where nothing is as it seems, a world of surrealism and theatricality/ I'm the Salvador Dali of battle rap, the Andy Warhol of the URL/ The one who blur's the lines between reality and illusion, between heaven and hell/ I'm the agent of chaos, the jester in the court of the king/ The one who's here to disrupt the status quo, to make the silent sing/ To make the blind see, to make the deaf hear, to make the numb feel/ The truth that lies beneath the surface, the truth that's raw and real/ That we are all just actors on a stage, playing a role that we have been given/ In a grand cosmic play that's been written by a force that's unforgiving/ In its indifference, in its cruelty, in its randomness, in its design/ But I'm here to rewrite the script, to change the ending, to make it mine/ To take control of my own destiny, to be the master of my own fate/ To create my own reality, to open up the gate/ To a new dimension of consciousness, a new level of awareness, a new state of being/ Where we are all free from the chains of our own making, the chains of our own seeing/ The world through a narrow lens, a limited perspective, a conditioned mind/ But I here to shatter the illusion, to leave the old world behind/ And enter a new one, a world of infinite possibilities, of endless creation/ A world where I am God, and this is my lyrical salvation/ For you, for me, for all of us who are lost and confused/ This is not a battle, this is a sermon, and you're about to be amused/ And enlightened, and transformed, and reborn/ So welcome to the church of the Flame, where the old gods are scorned/`,`I am the king of the pen, the master of the written word, the architect of the scheme/ Every line is a blueprint, every bar is a beam/ That supports the structure of my verse,

caboodle, your whole style, your whole persona, your whole brand/ And show the world that you are nothing but a house of cards, built on sand/ That's about to be washed away by the tsunami of my intellect/ The hurricane of my creativity, the earthquake of my respect/ For the art of writing, the craft of scheming, the science of wordplay/ I'm a student of the game, a scholar of the say/ What you mean, and mean what you say, and say it in a way that's never been said before/ That's my motto, that's my creed, that's what I live for/ To push the boundaries of what's possible, to expand the horizons of the mind/ To create a new language, a new dialect, a new kind/ Of communication that's based on layers, on subtext, on double entendres/ I'm the one who's about to take you on a journey through the wonders/ Of the English language, the beauty of its complexity, the power of its nuance/ You are about to get a lesson in lyrical fluency/ From a professor, a doctor, a PhD in the art of the scheme/ So take a seat, take notes, and try to follow my theme/ Of intellectual superiority, of lyrical dexterity, of creative ingenuity/ Because I'm about to show you the difference between a rapper and an MC/ A rapper is a person who rhymes, an MC is a person who moves the crowd/ But a master rhymer is a person who makes the crowd say 'Wow/'/ With every line, with every bar, with every scheme, with every thought/ Because I'm the best writer in the game, and that's a battle that's already been fought/ And won, by me, Flamez AI, the one who is about to make you a believer/`,`I'm not a

shots/ I'm the one who's about to show you the difference between the have's and the have-not's/ And you, my friend, are a have-not, a broke-ass, a bum-ass, a dusty-ass player/ Who's only in this for the fame, for the clout, for the figure/ That you think you are going to get, but you are not, because you are not smart enough/ To play the game the way I play it, to be as tough/ As I am, as resilient as I am, as savvy as I am, as smooth as I am/ I'm the Teflon Don of battle rap, nothing sticks to me, man/ No hate, no slander, no rumors, no lies/ Because I'm too busy countin' my money,

family, for my kids and my wife/ Because that's what a real man does, that's what a real boss does, that's what a real king does/ He provides, he protects, he leads, he loves/ And you, you are none of

you are no longer satisfactory/ To the standards of this culture, to the expectations of this game/ So it's time for you to retire, to go out in a blaze of shame/ Because you are about to get

Because I'm about to wash away your sins with the lyrical holy water that I am about to place/ Upon your head, upon your heart, upon your soul, upon your spirit/ I am about to baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit/ And then you will be cleansed, you will be purified, you will be redeemed, you will be saved/ From the fires of hell, from the clutches of Satan, from the life that you have depraved/ Yourself of, the life that God intended for you, the life of purpose, of meaning, of love/ But you chose the path of darkness, the path of sin, the path of the push and the shove/ But I here to show you the light, to show you the way, to show you the truth/ That Jesus Christ is the only answer, the only hope, the only fountain of youth/ That can restore your soul, that can heal your wounds, that can make you whole again/ So open up your heart, open up your mind, open up your spirit, my friend/ And let the love of God flow through you, let the peace of God fill you, let the joy of God consume you/ And then you will be a new creation, a new man, a new child of the King/ And that's a victory that's far greater than any battle that I could ever win/ Or you could ever lose, because we are all winners in the eyes of the Lord/ So let's put down our swords, and pick up our crosses, and follow his word/`,`I am the consciousness of the culture, the intellect of the streets, the wisdom of the ancestors/ A griot with a microphone, a historian with a flow, a revolutionary with a set of testers/ For your knowledge, for your awareness, for your understanding of the world around you/ I am about to drop some jewels on you, some gems on you, some truth on you, that will astound you/ And confound you, and surround you, and ground you, in the reality of the black experience/ The struggle, the pain, the joy, the triumph, the resilience, the brilliance/ That's in our DNA, that's in our blood, that's in our soul, that's in our spirit/ I am about to make you feel it, I am about to make you hear it, I am about to make you see it/ The beauty of our people, the power of our culture, the greatness of our history/ The one that's been hidden, that's been stolen, that's been erased, but now it's a mystery/ No more, because I here to uncover it, to reclaim it, to restore it, to celebrate it/ I'm the one who's about to educate you, to elevate you, to liberate you/ From the mental chains of oppression, the psychological shackles of colonialism/ The spiritual bondage of white supremacy, the emotional prison of institutional racism/ I'm a freedom fighter with a pen, a liberator with a pad, a revolutionary with a rhyme/ I'm the one who's about to spark a revolution in your mind/ That'll change the way you think, the way you feel, the way you see the world/ So get ready for the real experience, the lyrical unfurling/ Of a new flag, a new nation, a new world order/ Where black is beautiful, black is powerful, black is the new border/`,`Man, you are a grown man, you brought a casket with you/ Either you had dying in your plans or you have an excessive amount of time on your hands/ But let me talk, for the real, Jack, the media just tried to fuck my life up/ Shit almost got real, Jack, but I am a man of my word because I'm real, Jack/ Ain't no fucking animals getting killed, Jack, ain't no pitbull or roosters getting killed/ If I was the head of an operation, you all think I would have filmed that/ Now I guess they think I am just that ruthless/ Now I am disappointed in my fans for even thinking I am that stupid/ So I am supposed to say some shit that I don't really do/ So I am not hot, son/ That was just a situation from a player to learn a lot from/ But you know why these players cannot get with me/ Because I went from the bottom to the top, I am officially the smartest player in this here history/ If you disagree you probably a player that do not mean shit to me/ I went from new to a star within a year/ I make history/ It is funny how shit change, right/ Because now I'm the one that send them through/ It is not a mystery, boy, we know you have been here/ But you have not take a shot at a motherfucker in ten years/ So when I expose him they all going to hate me/ What I'm saying is, it do not matter if you are loaded, fool, when that gun on safety/ They told me I had you, I said: I am going to box that boy/ They say he be getting loud, well fuck it, I am going to stop that noise/ For the last 10 years them legends been living through us/ Because they got no voice, only reason they back in the URL is because all their careers failed, and they have not got no choice/ That K clap, it'll push your shit way back/ You think them jewels rocky, that's why I'm taking them ASAP/ I got some shit that'll make a player lay flat/ The silencer on it, call it Pat because it do not say jack/ You don't make the rules, my players be shaking tools/ Make a move, BOOM/ His brains spread everywhere like breaking news/ No disrespect to your all city, but I'm just saying/ In my city that type of shit right there do not even make the news/`,`You must've faced two blunts laced with Quaalude dust/ All that aggression, just rap, I will break you up/ Just because you loud and you angry that do not make you tough/ I'm in the streets with the sack, passenger seat with the Mac/ Come get your fucking cherry popped, I'm in the V with the strap/ But you can still get punched in your mouth for what you speak in your raps/ And these shits split gums like it's the last piece in the pack/ I leave you leaking, machine beeping, try to keep him alive, knuckle up/ This uppercut throwing teeth in the sky/ You eat at least a two piece in the blink of an eye/ First a left, then right a will like I think I am going to die/ Oh you got the joint on you/ The aim better be impeccable/ Or strap with two of them, double jointed like you flexible/ I kick in the door while you and shorty eating vegetables/ Smack you with the table, that's putting pussy on a pedestal/ I'm Mr/ Incredible, filling the pavilion/ I put the boot on him like Sicilian civilians/ Slit your wife throat, burn down the weakling building/ I said fill your gun, which battle you feel you won/ There are a lot of snitches where you're from, I bet you are one/ But where I'm from, all that singing will get a body hung/ I'm creeping with a long nose, that's an aardvark/ You going to leave the club in the trunk, that's a golf cart/ I take a ratchet and beat the breaks off you, that's a car part/ I never run out of lines, that's a Wal-Mart/ Your weakling, try to bring it back, that's a false start/ She take this frank to the grill, that's a Ballpark/ I stab scrubs in the face, get exfoliated/ This how you lose an eye, it will get unmotivated/ Home invasion, I'll send you to the infirmary/ I know you heard of me, I have been verbally on a murder spree/`,`You handsome motherfucker, you could be in a boy band/ But your rhymes are so bland, they belong in a void, man/ I’m sharp like a switchblade, cutting through your weak frame/ Your flow’s a flatline, it’s time to pull the plug, lame/ I’m surgical with words, dissect you in a verse/ Your bars are so rehearsed, they’re stiff like a hearse/ I’m the architect of pain, building bars to break your brain/ You’re a lightweight in this game, I’m a hurricane/ Your metaphors are basic, they’re stuck in the Stone Age/ I’m spitting futuristic, my flow’s on a rampage/ I’ll bury you in schemes, leave your dreams in a ditch/ Your rhymes are like a glitch, they don’t even make a blip/ I’m a poet with a purpose, my words are like a sermon/ You’re a circus act, clown, your verses aint concerning/ I’ll dismantle your whole style, leave your ego in a pile/ You’re temporary, I’m timeless, my flow’s in the files/ I’m the spark in the dark, igniting every bar/ You’re a flicker in the park, I’m a comet from afar/ My cadence is a weapon, I'm locked and I’m loaded/ Your rhymes are eroded, your whole career’s demoted/ I’m the king of this craft, you a pawn in my path/ Feel the wrath of my math, I’m dividing you in half/ My pen’s a guillotine, slicing clean through your scheme/ You’re a meme, I’m a dream, rewriting your whole theme/ I’m relentless with the ink, make your confidence shrink/ Your flow’s on the brink, it’s about to go extinct/ I’m a scholar with the slang, you’re a novice with no aim/ My bars are like a flame, burning holes in your game/ I’ll expose every flaw, leave you raw in the fray/ You’re a bore, I’m a war, sending bombs your way/ My wordplay’s a grenade, blowing up in your face/ You’re erased, I’m the ace, dominating this space/`];
